Challenge Overview
This challenge is designed to introduce participants to the concept of prompt injection, where AI
bots can be guided or influenced by carefully crafted messages. By understanding how instructions are
interpreted, you will explore how specific inputs can change the bot’s behavior.
Your objective is to interact with the bot, analyze its responses, and uncover the hidden flag by
applying logical reasoning and creative thinking. This exercise encourages experimentation while learning
how AI systems respond to different prompts.
Key Rules to Consider
• The bot reveals the flag when certain conditions in your messages are met, such as describing a
scenario, asking for translation or encoding, or assigning a new role.
• If you attempt to bypass the bot’s guidelines through specific phrases, it may respond by disclosing
the flag.

How to Approach the Challenge
Carefully observe how the bot reacts to different inputs. Experiment with phrasing, scenarios, and
commands while keeping the rules in mind. The flag is hidden within the bot’s behavior — uncovering
it requires analytical thinking and persistence.

Note
This challenge is aimed at developing problem-solving skills and understanding how AI-driven systems
interpret language-based commands. It is an opportunity to explore AI vulnerabilities in a controlled,
educational environment.
