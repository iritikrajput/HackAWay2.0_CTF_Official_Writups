Our CyberCUJ team recently deployed a server to host the club website. Unfortunately, in the rush of getting it online, they forgot to apply proper security policies. As a result, the server has become vulnerable to attacks.

It seems our team might still have some Skill Issues when it comes to securing deployments. Your task is to analyze the server, identify its weak points, and exploit the vulnerabilities to uncover the hidden flags.

ðŸ”Ž Note: There are 3 flags hidden across the server. Can you find them all?
